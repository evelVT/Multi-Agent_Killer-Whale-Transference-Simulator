# Multi-Agent_Killer-Whale-Transference-Simulator
Simulating dialect transference in Killer Whalese using a Multi-Agent system. Built for Multi-agent systems. 

This code has been built in Python 3.12.5. It was made to run on windows, for other systems all references to the ctypes package need to be removed (import + 1 other line in Multi-Agent_KW_Sim.py)
The requirements.txt should be up-to-date.

To run the code, run Multi-Agent_KW_Sim.py
